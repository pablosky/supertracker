mix.exs -> gemfile
mix deps.get -> bundle

create user model

mix phoenix.gen.model User users email:string name:string password_hash:string is_admin:boolean

rake db:migrate ->  mix ecto.migrate

rails s -> mix phoenix.server

rails routes -> mix phx.routes

like byebug
  require IEx; IEx.pry
  run iex -S mix test


login -> create, user (registration) (new, create, show)
      -> session handling (new, create, delete)

  defmodule Math do

    def sum(x) do
      x + 0
    end

    def sum(x, y) do
      x + y
    end
  end
  So in this you have two similar yet different functions: sum/1 and sum/2.
